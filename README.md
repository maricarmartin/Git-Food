## Description

GIT.FOOD is user friendly and convenient website if you’re looking for a restaurant to enjoy dine in with a specific cuisine. You’ll see nearby places and can also check the local weather to determine if it's better to walk or drive.

## Problem / Motivation

As a group we choose an app concept that we all understood and have had experience using.

We decided to add our own creative twist to the standard restaurant search app by adding an updated weather icon feature. This is so that when a user is looking up nearby restaurants, they can also see the current weather.

For this reason it’s different than most food search apps but simultaneously offers the same basic functions you would expect from a food search app. This includes a map with marked nearby restaurants within a 5km radius, a list of those options with photo examples of the food the restaurant serves and a form to fill out preferences.

## How the project addresses the problem

The website will allow users to enter their location google places will return the restaurants nearby.

## API sources for data

- OpenWeatherMap API 3.0

## Note
*It's hard for commits to do justice to the work that we've done as a team. Often, our work involved us working with the pair-programming principle with all four of us working off of one shared screen. Each team member has contributed greatly to the project, and the project would not have succeeded without the input of any one of us.
